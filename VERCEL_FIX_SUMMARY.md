# Fixing Vercel Deployment Issue

## Issues Identified

1. **Invalid package.json syntax**: There was a missing comma between the "scripts" and "dependencies" sections in package.json, which caused the server to fail to start.

2. **Incorrect Vercel configuration**: The vercel.json file had incorrect routing configuration for static assets and was using an outdated build configuration.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed package.json syntax
- Added the missing comma between "scripts" and "dependencies" sections
- Verified the JSON structure is now valid

### 2. Updated vercel.json configuration
- Changed from the old "framework": "vite" configuration to proper builds configuration
- Used "@vercel/static-build" for the frontend build with correct distDir setting
- Kept "@vercel/node" for the server.js backend
- Updated routes to properly serve static assets:
  - API routes go to server.js
  - Cesium assets served from /cesium/
  - Favicon served correctly
  - All other routes serve index.html (SPA routing)

### 3. Added vercel-build script
- Added a "vercel-build" script to package.json that runs "vite build"
- This ensures Vercel uses the correct build command

## Testing
- Verified the build process works locally with `npm run build`
- Tested the server locally and confirmed:
  - API endpoints are accessible at http://localhost:3001/api/*
  - Main page is served correctly at http://localhost:3001/
  - Static assets are properly served

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Redeploy to Vercel
3. The 404 NOT_FOUND error should be resolved
