# Station Coordinate Fixing Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Placeholder Coordinates**: Fixed stations with placeholder coordinates like (0,0) or (40,-100) that were appearing in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

2. **Missing Geolocation Data**: Added proper latitude and longitude coordinates for stations that previously had no location data.

3. **Invalid Coordinates**: Corrected coordinates that were outside valid ranges or had other issues.

## Files Updated

- `src/data/tvStationsWithUrls.json` - TV stations with fixed coordinates
- `src/data/radioStations.json` - Radio stations with fixed coordinates

## Scripts Created

1. `fixStationCoordinates.js` - Initial script to fix coordinates
2. `fixStationCoordinatesImproved.js` - Enhanced version with better error handling
3. `fixStationCoordinatesRobust.js` - More robust version with better validation
4. `fixAllStationCoordinatesProperly.js` - Improved version that updates files in place
5. `fixStationCoordinatesFinal.js` - Final version that handles edge cases
6. `verifyStationCoordinates.js` - Script to verify coordinate validity

## How to Maintain Data Quality

To periodically check and fix station coordinates:

1. Run the verification script:
   ```
   node verifyStationCoordinates.js
   ```

2. If issues are found, run the fixing script:
   ```
   node fixStationCoordinatesFinal.js
   ```

3. The scripts will:
   - Identify stations with invalid or placeholder coordinates
   - Use OpenStreetMap Nominatim to geocode locations
   - Cache results to minimize API calls
   - Respect API rate limits with delays between requests
   - Provide detailed logging of actions taken

## Coordinate Validation Rules

Valid coordinates must:
- Have latitude between -90 and 90
- Have longitude between -180 and 180
- Not be placeholder values like (0,0) or (40,-100)

## Future Improvements

1. Add more sophisticated geocoding with fallback services
2. Implement batch processing for better performance
3. Add automated testing to ensure data quality
4. Create a web interface for manual correction of difficult cases
