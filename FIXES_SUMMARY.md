# Fixing Vercel Deployment and API Connection Issues

## Issues Identified

1. **Invalid package.json syntax**: There was a missing comma between the "scripts" and "dependencies" sections, which caused the server to fail to start.

2. **Incorrect Vercel configuration**: The vercel.json file had outdated routing configuration that wasn't properly serving static assets.

3. **API connection issue**: The frontend was hardcoded to use `http://localhost:3001/api` as the API base URL, which works locally but not in a Vercel deployment.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed package.json syntax
- Added the missing comma between "scripts" and "dependencies" sections
- Verified the JSON structure is now valid

### 2. Updated vercel.json configuration
- Changed from the old "framework": "vite" configuration to proper builds configuration
- Used "@vercel/static-build" for the frontend build with correct distDir setting
- Kept "@vercel/node" for the server.js backend
- Updated routes to properly serve static assets:
  - API routes go to server.js
  - Cesium assets served from /cesium/
  - Favicon served correctly
  - All other routes serve index.html (SPA routing)
- Added environment variable for API URL

### 3. Added vercel-build script
- Added a "vercel-build" script to package.json that runs "vite build"
- This ensures Vercel uses the correct build command

### 4. Fixed API connection issue
- Updated src/services/mediaService.js to use relative paths for API calls
- Added environment configuration files:
  - .env (default)
  - .env.development (for local development)
  - .env.production (for production deployments)
- Updated package.json to use proper mode for development

### 5. Updated development script
- Added --mode development flag to the vite command in the dev script

## Testing
- Verified the build process works locally with `npm run build`
- Tested the server locally and confirmed:
  - API endpoints are accessible at http://localhost:3001/api/*
  - Main page is served correctly at http://localhost:3001/
  - Static assets are properly served

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Redeploy to Vercel
3. The 404 NOT_FOUND error should be resolved
4. The API connection error should also be resolved

## How it works
- In local development, the app will use http://localhost:3001/api as the API base URL
- In production (Vercel), the app will use /api as the API base URL, which will be routed to the server.js backend
- All API calls are now relative, so they will work in both environments
